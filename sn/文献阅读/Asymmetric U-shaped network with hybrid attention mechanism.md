To alleviate above challenges, we developed a novel asymmetric U-shaped architecture to segment KUS images accurately and reliably. The U-shaped network designed in this paper is shown in Fig. 2. 
It is mainly composed of three functional modules: dense residual connection encoder, multi-step up-sampling decoder with the hybrid attention module and side-out deep supervision module.

Illustration of our proposed network architecture. It is mainly composed of three main functional modules: dense residual connection encoder, multi-step up-sampling decoder with hybrid attention module and side-out deep supervision module. Capturing sufficient kidney features from the input image is the main function of dense residual connection encoder (see Section 2.1). The hybrid attention module consists of a spatial attention model and a channel attention model. Its function is to improve the correlation between the encoder and the decoder and make the network pay more attention to the extraction of kidney features (see Section 2.4). By introducing the side-out deep supervision module (SO), the network learns to predict precise segmentation results scale-by-scale.
